here’s how to complete that “Hello world” debug message task step by step.
Objective

Create a Sass file that outputs a debug message:
Hello world

Steps

In your project directory (0x03-sass_scss), create a file named:
touch 0-debug_log.scss

Open the file and add this Sass code:
@debug 'Hello world';

Run this command in your terminal:
sass 0-debug_log.scss | head -n 0

Expected output:
0-debug_log.scss:2 DEBUG: Hello world

Explanation:

@debug is a Sass directive that prints messages to the standard error output (used for debugging).

'Hello world' is the string being printed.

The | head -n 0 part ensures no CSS output appears — only the debug message.
